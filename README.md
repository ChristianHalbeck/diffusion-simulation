# Diffusion Simulation

This is a simple program meant to show how diffusion works. It involves balls (particles) of two different colours (substances) moving around in a box, starting to move in a random direction and then bouncing off the walls. The two substances start out seperated, but will spread out evenly over time due to a statistical trend.

The program is currently lacking collisions between particles, though the effect is still just as visible. The UI is in German, but can easily be translated by changing some variables in the easy-to-modify section.
